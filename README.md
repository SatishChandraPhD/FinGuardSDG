**FinGuard-SDG** is a reproducible research codebase accompanying the paper:

**FinGuard-SDG: A Hybrid Multi-Agent Routing Architecture for Sustainable Financial Analytics**
(IEEE CSCloud 2025; extended journal version under preparation)

The repository provides:
  * a curated multi-task financial benchmark dataset aligned with the **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**,
  * and a **hybrid routing architecture** for financial AI systems that combines
    **keyword heuristics, encoder-based semantic routing, and selective LLM fallback**.

**🔍 Motivation**

Financial AI systems increasingly need to handle heterogeneous queries, including:
  * quantitative financial calculations,
  * conceptual finance questions,
  * ESG and sustainability analysis,
  * and advisory-style investor guidance.

Single-stage routing approaches struggle with **implicit reasoning**, especially for:
  * numerically implicit questions,
  * ESG–advisory overlap,
  * and ambiguous financial intent.

This work proposes and evaluates a **hybrid routing architecture** that is:
 * accurate,
 * computationally efficient,
 * and aligned with sustainable finance objectives.

**📊 Dataset: FinGuard-SDG Benchmark v1.0
**
**FinGuard_SDG_Benchmark_v1.0.csv** contains **1,160 finance-domain questions** across four categories:
| Category     | Description                                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quantitative | Numerical finance (TVM, bonds, portfolios, derivatives)          |
| Conceptual   | Financial theory, markets, risk, and regulation                  |
| ESG          | Environmental, Social, and Governance analysis aligned with SDGs |
| Advisory     | Investor profiling, allocation, scenario-based guidance          |



**Dataset highlights**
  * Designed for **routing, not QA generation**
  * Difficulty-balanced (easy / medium / hard)
  * SDG-aligned ESG coverage  
  * Suitable for **multi-agent financial systems
**
**Full dataset construction methodology is described in the paper.

A concise dataset overview is provided in docs/dataset_overview.md.
